## What This Site Includes

This website is designed as my final AP Computer Science project. It includes:

- An **About Me** section sharing my background and interests.
- A **project gallery** featuring three JavaScript games I developed:
  - Cookie Clicker
  - Hangman
  - Pong

Through building this site and the projects within it, I learned:

- How to organize a multi-page layout using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
- Implement interactive game mechanics with JavaScript.
- Handle user input, animations, and game state management.
- Apply responsive design principles and consistent theming.
