      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I am Devin Santos, a junior at Mt. Eden High School. This is my first year trying coding. Overall, this year has taught me so much. Working with C++ was very difficult at first but I soon found out that I could learn it pretty quickly. Just when I started getting comfortable with C++, we started using Javascript. This turned out to be even more difficult for me. But, once again after some time I was able to pick it up. Overall, I think it was a sucessful year because I've learned a whole bunch.</p>
